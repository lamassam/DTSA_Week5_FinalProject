# Introduction & Description of Data

In this report, we will be analyzing the NYPD Shooting Incident data sourced from the NYC OpenData website: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic. The data shows the breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2006 - 2022. Every record represents a shooting incident and includes information about the event, such as  details regarding the perpetrator, details regarding the victim, and the location of the incident. The data was last updated on September 2023. 

For this analysis, we will be looking to see if the perpetrators' demographics can be used to predict if the shooting is fatal.
